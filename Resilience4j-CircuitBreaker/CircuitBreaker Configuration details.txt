1) failure-rate-threshold=80
        -indicates that if 80% of requests are getting failed, open the circuit ie. Make the Circuit Breaker state as Open.

2) sliding-window-size=10
        -indicates that if 80% of requests out of 10 (it means 8) are failing, open the circuit.

3) sliding-window-type=COUNT_BASED 
        - indicates that we are using COUNT_BASED sliding window. Another type is TIME_BASED.

4) minimum-number-of-calls=5
        - indicates that we need at least 5 calls to calculate the failure rate threshold.

5) automatic-transition-from-open-to-half-open-enabled=true
        - indicates that donâ€™t switch directly from the open state to the closed state, consider the half-open state also.

6) permitted-number-of-calls-in-half-open-state=4
        -indicates that when on half-open state, consider sending 4 requests. If 80% of them are failing, switch circuit breaker to open state.

7) wait-duration-in-open-state=1s
        -indicates the waiting time interval while switching from the open state to the closed state.
